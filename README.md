# Chatty
Simple IM Platform

Instructions on how to run:

1- Open this folder in VSCode.

2- Open the Terminal.

3- Run npm install (if you don't already have the latest version of node.js installed)

4- Run npm run dev (this will start the server)

5- Go to http://localhost:3000

To experiment with multiple users at once, you can open multiple tabs on http://localhost:3000. Each one will connect a different socket and thus a different user to the server. To use chatty, just pick a name and select a chat room to join. You can then send messages inside the chat room and see the other users in that room along with their messages in real time.
